    <p>Linux traditionally operates in text mode. Linux encourages its users to acquire
    knowledge and to become independent. Inevetably, you will have to read a lot of
    documentation to achieve that goal. The more docs you read, the easier it will
    become and the faster you will leaf through manuals. Make reading documentation a
    habit as soon as possible. When you don't know the answer to a problem, refering
    to the documentation should become a second nature.</p>

    <p>When programmers can read, distribute and change code, the code will mature.
    People can adapt it, fix it, debug it. This software will be more flexible and of a
    better quality than software that has been developed using the conventional
    channels, because more people have tested it in more different conditions than the
    closed software developer ever can.</p>

    <p>When we run the command, the shell sees that it should execute that command, and
    then searches through the :-separated list of directories in $PATH for a file by
    that name. We can find out which file is executed for a given program name using the
    <code>which</code> command. We can also bypass $PATH entirely by giving the path to
    the file we want to execute.</p>

    <h4>Permissions:</h4>
    <p>r - list its contents of a directory <br>
    w - add/remove files in a directory <br>
    x - permission to enter a directory </p>

    <p>Operations like |, >, and < are done by the shell, not by the individual program.
    They just read from their input and write to their output, whatever it may be.</p>

    <p>Sources list: /etc/apt/sources.list <br>
    Console fonts: /usr/share/consolefonts/ </p>

    <p>To list essential packages in Debian: <br>
    dpkg-query -Wf '${Package; -40}${Essential}\n' | grep yes </p>
