		<p>Xmonad is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in Haskell. Windows are managed using automatic layout algorithm, which can be dynamically reconfigured.
	           At any time windows are arranged so as to maximize the use of screen real estate. All features of the window manager are accessible purely from the keyboard. Xmonad
	           is configured in Haskell, and custom layout algorithms may be implemented by the user in config files. A principle of Xmonad is predictabiligy: the user should know
		   in advance precisely the window arrangement that will result from any action.</p>
		<p>By default, Xmonad provides three layout algorithms: tall, wide and fullscreen. In tall or wide mode, windows are tiled and arranged to prevent overlap and maximize
		   screen use. Sets of windows are grouped together on virtual screens. and each screen retains its own layout, which may be reconfigured dynamically. Multiple physical
		   monitors are supported via Xinerama, allowing simultaneous display of a number of screens.</p>
